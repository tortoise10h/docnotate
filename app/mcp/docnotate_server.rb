# DocNotate's MCP server assembly.
#
# Referenced from config/routes.rb — routes load after initialization, so the
# tool classes under app/tools are autoloadable by the time the server is
# built (they are not available in config/initializers).
#
# MCP::Server only stores metadata and tool classes; it knows nothing about
# transports. The transport is created in routes.rb and mounted as a Rack app
# at /mcp, which is why the same server could later be driven over stdio.
